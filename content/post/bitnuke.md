**Bitnuke** is an anonymous volatile file storage service.  

* I created this service to be used by primarily a small group of friends and I but it quickly became a public service to be used by all!  Sometimes we want to share files and not have to worry about removing them at a later time.  
* Originally this service was just an API but since it's conception I have added a frontend.  
* This service stores files(securely) for 24 hours and then deletes them permanently.  
* The site now also features **persistent uploads** (with secure account management in the works) and a **link shortener** that will shorten the URL of any link to 4 characters.  
* As always, please check out the code [here](https://github.com/unixvoid/bitnuke) (feel free to use the code or send me PR's), and visit the site over at [bitnuke.io](https://bitnuke.io).
